### The project

This project was started to learn and use Tailwind CSS effectively. It's entirely focused on styling the interface, without involving any JavaScript. Before this, I was using Bootstrap, but I often felt pretty limited when trying to style my interface the way I wanted only using the classes available. Tailwind appears to offer much more flexibility in this aspect. I'm excited to create additional pages using this framework and explore its versatility further.

### What I learned

Essentially, every class I've added in this project marks a step in my Tailwind learning journey. I've covered various topics, but the ones I find crucial and will continue using are Flexbox, Grid, hover effects, and, in my view, the most significant features: Tailwind's configuration options and the @apply directive. These have been my key takeaways and will play a major role in my ongoing exploration and application of Tailwind CSS.

```css

/*example configuring new colors and font sizes inside the tailwind.config.js file*/

theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: "#4F7942",
        secondary: {
          100: "#f5f0e8",
          200: "#ebe0d0",
        },
      },
      fontFamily: {
        chef: " 'Shadows Into Light', cursive",
      },
    },
  }

```
